# Attendance_Monitoring
This short project uses the facial_recognition library in python which has been made using dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning. It contains a folder "images" containing images sored in the database and a test image needs to be placed in the same directory as the script and named as "my_image.jpg" which will be checked for similarity against the database.
